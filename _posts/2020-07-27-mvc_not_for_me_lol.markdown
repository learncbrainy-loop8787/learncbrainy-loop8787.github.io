Working on myb mvc sinatra project has been tough but rewarding. i felt like dropping out for the last week.Something kept me going. I know i could i just had to dig deeper. More code than ive ever had to deal with in my life. im so happy i did not quit. The hard par was not being good at something and still trying. Im not used to loesing anything. Getting stumped isnt something im good at . But enough about yesterday, its time to go live!
