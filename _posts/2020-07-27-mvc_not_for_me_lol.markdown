Let the titlle say it all! Finshed my Sinatra procoderject and i feel great! Now i feel like a real coder. "Whats new pussy cat" you say? Seeing my code come to like with shotgun. Using shotgun has allowed me to view all my hard working code in the browser. From the controller which gets the users request, to the view which is seen by the user. MVC has also been very cool to use.Models, Veiws, Controllers! This dynamic trio has been essential in making coding structure much more readable. It has brung organization to my coding experience. Now that my users and sessions are protected using codes like :session_secret and validates. Im am on to rails, where my routes are condensed in resources  and my get '/' are actions. Untill we meet agin reader of blogs.  Learny_brain out...
