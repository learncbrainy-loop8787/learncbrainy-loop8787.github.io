From using _forms to dry my views to using omniaauth to allow my app users to login through their facebook. I have grown as a developer because of the fie ive risen from. I went from assigning a word to an array to assigning each user an id. Rails resorces have allowed me to code much easier. People told me that it would simplify the coding processes and they didnt lie. The hardest part now is explaning what Ive learned in a professional manor. Till next time may the algorithm be with you.
