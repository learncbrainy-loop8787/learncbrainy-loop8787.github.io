I spent most of my life after high school working hard. My days have mostly been spent breaking my back for someone else’s gain. I always knew I was capable of more but never moved on the ideal. I showed abilities well beyond the task that I was doing for most my life. I began to teach myself mandarin and stock trading in my spare time. I came across a application called Grasshopper. It was an application for my phone that taught coding. I completed multiple portions and still had a hunger for more. I then took on the bootcamp prep from flatiron training course. After completing 25% I knew if I didn’t capitalize on what I had learned it would all go away. In short it was a combination of things that lead me to become a software engineer. Money, the challenge, opportunity. Mostly just tired of working hard to break even.
